# What is MarTeXTation?

 - Ease creation of presentation making.
 - GUI: too much effort, not portable, bloated, not for programmers,...
 - Solution: convert markdown to "binaries" (HTM*, TeXPDF, ...)
 - and... lazily add features to the "compiler" by need
 
----

# Main focus on scientific presentations

 - TeX formatted formulas: $\phi=\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$
